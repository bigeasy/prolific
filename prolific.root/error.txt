Multiple versions of `prolific` module.

Your `node_modules` contains multiple version of the module `prolific`.
The `prolific` module is a Singleton. One single instance of the module
is used to store common properties for all the loggers in program.

Please remove all but a single top most instance of `prolific` in your
`node_modules` directory. If you are using a consistant version string
across your modules NPM will do this automatically.
