// Prolific has wrestled long and hard with the confusing available Node.js
// events for program shutdown. It was born of a desire to capture the fatal
// stack trace from a Node.js process and send it to a networked logging
// infrastructure. It was born from a frustration with the brutal performance of
// the "best practice" logging to standard out when standard out is synchronous
// in Node.js. We want to log somewhere asynchronously when times are good for
// performance, but we want to log somewhere synchronously when times are bad
// because there might not be another tick available to talk to the network.

// The "uncaughtException" handler is a final handler, or it should be. You
// should do something synchronous then rethrow the error. This is where
// Prolific began. Writing that error to standard error in such a way that a
// monitor could forward it to the network.

// It seemed then that the "exit" handler was the place to handle ordinary exit,
// and that hooking the "exit" handler would be a way to allow Prolific to
// shutdown normally by writing it's shutdown messages to standard error.

// However, default handlers for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` do not invoke `"exit"`.
// `"exit"` is really a work-queue-had-drained event, not an exit event.
// `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` halt the program without working through the work
// queue. This came as a surprise. It's something that I forget about until I
// return to work on Prolific and wonder how it ever became so complicated.

// This caused me to create a lot of options and to find ways to determine the
// exit of a child process from the monitor.

// However, in the sort of network programming where I want to log to a
// networked logger I always hook `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` and endeavor to unwind
// my work queue myself. If I can't unwind the work queue, I throw an exception.
// This means I'm always going to reach either `"uncaughtExcpetion"` or
// `"exit"`.

// This initial confusion about `"exit"` lead me to hedge against other
// behaviors that might surprise me. Time has passed and here's what I figure.

// If you need really robust multi-process logging, then defeat those signal
// handlers and unwind your program. If it can't unwind then that is an
// exception. I have a library called Destructible that throws an uncatchable
// exception with an elaborate stack trace that shows which operations blocked
// exit.

// If you really want a quick and dirty client I can probably detect that you're
// done from the supervisor when your child exits, so long as you're not having
// children wink in and out of existence. But that's unlikely for a program like
// a command line utlity where you might want to have Node.js just scram your
// work queue when you exit.

//

// Close the asynchronous pipe and log chunks to standard error. This needs to
// be called in response to `SIGTERM` or else the asynchronous pipe will keep
// the program from exiting.

// Breaking up long buffers.

// TODO First, we need to prepend a new line so that if our write is interleaved
// in the output of another process that intends to write a large buffer to
// standard error. This is not unlikely given the size of the exception stack
// traces generated by your `Interrupt` library. With a preceding newline we
// would be able to spot the start of our chunk. We could then discard the
// preceding newline and not print it to standard error.

// TODO Second, we need to split up chunks so that the fit with `PIPE_BUF`. This
// splitting is going to happen often on OS X where `PIPE_BUF` is a mere 512
// bytes. Splitting lines is going to be made difficult by Unicode. If there are
// Unicode characters we don't want to split in the middle of character because
// we want to write valid UTF-8 to standard error. Looked around a bit for a
// utility, then looked a Unicode and remembered that I'd done this before.
// That is, I'd looked for a utility then realized that finding the start of a
// Unicode character is trivial.

// Send a group of entries inside chunks on standard error. We need to split the
// entires JSON up into chunks that will fit in `PIPE_BUF` sized buffers so that
// our writes to standard error are atomic and our chunks are not broken up by
// the output of other processes.

// For each entries array JSON we first write a control chunk that contains a
// checksum of the JSON and a count of subsequent body content chunks that will
// contain the JSON. We then write out the body content chunks.

// There's some description of the chunk format in the `chunk.js` file in the
// `prolific.chunk` project.
